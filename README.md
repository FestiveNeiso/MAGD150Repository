This one requires a web server to host it, simply opening the html file, like with the others, wont work. The program reflects what it sees in your camera and mimics the last frequency it hears in the mic! It's kinda fun! and REALLY cool. There's also a button to prevent the mic from picking up a new sound, when off it'll just play its last heard value.
